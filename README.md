**:wrench: A repo containing collaborative lessons on open science hardware**

I start this repo because I was asked to teach a course on open science hardware at University, and I guess this is a situation that will be more and more frequent in the future for people in the open science hardware community.

I think we can have a much better curriculum if we follow open principles and the collaborative model.

I really like [The Carpentries](https://github.com/carpentries/) approach, but I think for now it's good if we start small.

## Goal
To introduce people to fundamentals of open science hardware, opportunities, challenges, resources and practical knowledge on how to go from an idea to a prototype (and maybe more).

## Who?
I'm thinking of Master's and PhD students, as the request came from someone in a Bioinformatics / Biotech Masters degree.

## Contributing
- Discuss the goal and the who
- Start proposing lessons in the [List of lessons](/lessons.md)
- Start drafting the [Lesson template](/leson_template.md): What should a lesson have, look like?
- Suggest resources
